# # Auto-GTP Generation Webpage for Transformers

This project is a web-based calculator designed to automatically generate the **Guaranteed Technical Particulars (GTP)** for various types of transformers. It streamlines the engineering process by automating complex calculations required for transformer specification and design.

> This tool was custom-built and is specially dedicated to supporting the engineering and design teams at **Mahati Industries**.



## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this application is to:
* **Automate** complex and repetitive technical calculations.
* **Reduce** the time required for generating GTP sheets.
* **Ensure accuracy** and consistency in technical specifications.
* **Provide a centralized tool** for different transformer designs.

## ✨ Key Features

This webpage provides automated calculations for essential transformer parameters, including (but not limited to):

* Efficiency
* Basic Insulation Level (BIL)
* Minimum Clearances (Phase-to-Phase, Phase-to-Ground)
* Voltage Regulation
* Impedance
* And other critical electrical and mechanical data.

## 🔌 Transformer Types Covered

This tool currently supports GTP generation for the following transformer categories:

* **Distribution Transformers**
* **Power Transformers**
* **Converter Transformers**
* **Dry Type Transformers**

## 💻 Technologies Used

This is a lightweight web application built with:

* **HTML5:** For the structure of the webpage.
* **CSS3:** For styling and user interface.
* **JavaScript:** For all the calculation logic and interactivity.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. save everything in one folder.
2.  Open the `main page.html` file in any modern web browser.
3.  Select the type of transformer you wish to calculate.
4.  Enter the required input parameters (e.g., KVA rating, voltage levels).
5.  The application will automatically compute and display the Guaranteed Technical Particulars.
6. can save as pdf on you local computer.
